# AI-Powered-Histology-Image-Classification
This project aims to develop an AI-powered software tool that uses deep learning to classify histology images of skin tissue as cancerous or non-cancerous. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the software will assist dermatologists by providing rapid preliminary diagnoses, thus enhancing the speed and accuracy of skin cancer detection.
